##Zeke´s Bill Splitter web app (all front, no backend)

This web app allows you to separate the check for a group of people, according to what each one consumed, avoiding unfair bill-splitting. It was created as a Next.js project (although it doesn´t use a lot of Next.js functionality, except for the page routing. The styling is made mostly with Tailwind, with other libraries such as SweetAlert2 and DaisyUI.
